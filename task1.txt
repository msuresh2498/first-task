HTTP1 VS HTTP2

HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. 
HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster.
The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. Because it went through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. 
This version is still in use on the web. In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.
HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. 
One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.



Objects And Its Internal Representation In JavaScript

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
